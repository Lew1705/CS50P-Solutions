📘 CS50P — Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard’s CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python.
Each problem set folder includes my implementation of the required exercises, written according to the course’s specifications.

🗂️ Contents

Pset 0 — Functions, conditionals, and simple programs
Pset 1 — Conditionals, loops, and debugging
Pset 2 — Loops, exceptions, and libraries
Pset 3 — Unit tests and error handling
Pset 4 — File I/O and regular expressions
Pset 5 — Object-oriented programming
Pset 6 — File handling, APIs, and data manipulation
Pset 7 — Classes, inheritance, and more Pythonic design
Pset 8 — Final project (if included)

▶️ Running the Programs

Most solutions can be run with:

python <filename>.py

🎯 Goals
